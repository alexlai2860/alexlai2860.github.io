# Research Projects

- **Gait Face Fusion Recognition System Based on Multi Perspective Collaboration**  
  *Duration: 2023.9 – 2024.5*  
  A national-level project developing a multi-person gait recognition system with a visual interface that integrates facial and gait features. I led the design and implementation of an occlusion gait restoration module to significantly improve recognition accuracy.

- **Auto-Focus-Assistant**  
  *Duration: 2022.11 – 2023.6*  
  An independent R&D project leveraging depth cameras and advanced computer vision techniques to deliver an efficient auto-focus system. The system processes spatial depth and RGB data using YolofastestV2 for object detection, supporting multiple focusing modes including manual, automatic, and continuous tracking.

- **Original Aspiration: RoboMaster Short Film Project**  
  *Duration: 2022.9 – 2023.1*  
  A team-driven filmmaking project in which I served as the team leader. I managed screenplay, directing, cinematography, and post-production editing. The project documented the preparation for a robotics competition and received positive feedback.

- **National College Student Robot Competition (RoboMaster University Championship)**  
  *Duration: 2021.9 – 2022.7*  
  A robotics competition where I participated as a UAV team member. My responsibilities included designing and developing the UAV target detection system, collaborating on debugging and flight tests, and maintaining the robot vision library.
