## Conference Paper

- **CVPR'25: SnowMaster: Comprehensive Real-world Image Desnowing via MLLM with Multi-Model Feedback Optimization**  
  **Authors:** Jianyu Lai†, Sixiang Chen†, Yunlong Lin, Tian Ye, Yun Liu, Song Fei, Zhaohu Xing, Hongtao Wu, Weiming Wang, Lei Zhu.  
  **Summary:** Motivated by the limited generalization of current desnowing models due to their reliance on synthetic data and the lack of large-scale real-world snowfall datasets, this work introduces RealSnow10K, a large-scale annotated high-quality real-world snowfall dataset, and a preference dataset with 36,000 expert-ranked pairs. Furthermore, the SnowMaster desnowing framework leverages MMPO-enhanced Q-instruct for semi-supervised training to improve real-world snow removal performance.
